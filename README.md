Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

This is the systematic application of engineering principles and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
Software engineering helps in creation of softare applications that power various aspects of modern life such as communication and trnasport.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Development of programming languages such as C.
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements- This involves gathering and documentation of the system requirements and the user needs.
Design-Involves creation of high-level and detailed design of the software.
Implementation- Involves writing code and building of the software according to the design specifications.
Testing- THis phase involves testing the software if it meets the required specifications.
Deployment- The software is released to the end user.
Maintenance- This stage involves providing ongoing support, updates and software enhancements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall is a stricter, more linear methodology that limits a team's ability to diverge from the project plan at different stages in the SDLC. Agile, by contrast, gives teams a margin of flexibility at each stage of the SDLC, enabling them to change the course of a project and incorporate new feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions while the quality assurance engineer ensures the softare meets the required quality and specifications and finally the project manger oversees the overall process of SDLC.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs such as Visual Studio help in writing and testing of code while IDEs such as Git are important in enhancing productivity through teamwork.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Stright deadlines and changing requirements are one of the challenges faced by software engineers. Strategies for overcoming challenges include 
effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular 
reassessment of project goals and timelines 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing-Involves testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing-Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing-Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing-Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user 
needs.
These testing methods are important in detection of faults in the early stages of software development

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of constructing words in a manner that is understandable by AI models to get the best responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt
Write a summary of the article.
Improved prompt.
Write a 150-word summary of the article focusing on the main arguments presented by the author, including at least two supporting examples.

The improved prompt helps the AI to provide a more direct and clear response as compered to the vague prompt.
